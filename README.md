# PyCord


This project provides a Discord bot that allows you to run Python code directly from within a Discord server. Simply send a message containing Python code to the server, and the bot will execute it and send back the results.

Getting Started
To use this bot, you'll need to create a Discord application and add it to your server. Here's how:

Go to the Discord Developer Portal and sign in with your Discord account.
Click the "New Application" button to create a new application.
Give your application a name and click "Create".
Click the "Bot" tab on the left-hand side of the page, then click "Add Bot".
Customize your bot's name and avatar if you like, then click "Save Changes".
Click the "OAuth2" tab on the left-hand side of the page.
Under "Scopes", check the "bot" checkbox.
Under "Bot Permissions", check the "Send Messages" and "Read Message History" checkboxes.
Copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser. Follow the prompts to add the bot to your server.
Once you've added the bot to your server, you can start using it to run Python code.

Usage
To run Python code using the bot, simply send a message containing Python code to the server. The bot will automatically detect the code and execute it, then send the results back to the server in a message.

For example, you could send a message like this:

.python print("Hello, world!")

Or an example of multi line code you can do:

.python ```x = "Hello World" 
print(x)```
